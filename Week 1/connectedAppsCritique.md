**<p align="center">Connected Application Critique </p>**
The connected application chosen for this assignment is [Connected Worlds](https://classic.nysci.org/experiencenysci/exhibits/connected-worlds/). I chose this because I took a Human Development class last year that focused on Child Development and we were asked to create a playground at the end of the semester that is not traditional and would cater to children’s cognitive, physical, and emotional needs. For my project, I designed an Interactive playground that had some similarities to this so it resonated with me the most.

*What do I think works?*

Children (and adults) are able to interact with the screen and get a response. Their movements spark different elements that are projected as they can also push virtual objects across the screen. More than one person can play or interact with the display at the same time and all of their actions are reflected for everyone else. It gives them an imagined experience with cartoons and hypothetical characters. The screen covers a large area on the walls as well as the ground and gives the impression that they are actually inside and experiencing every aspect of it. 

*What does not work?*

The fact that it’s a projector and so the shadows of the children are shown on the display, preventing them from previewing the whole scene and giving a less realistic feeling. It also only connects people that are located at the same area even though it’s called Connected Worlds. I also do not feel that the fact that it raises awareness about sustainability is prominent or shown to be significant although that’s the main purpose of the interactive display. I felt that the children were just playing around without giving any attention to that aspect.

*What would I like to do differently?*

I would like to have it connected with the world in two other ways that would give a more elaborative and informative experience. One way is to have the same overall experience but with allowing people from different locations around the world interact with the same screen and have it reflect in all of the other displays. Maybe have the children make conversations with one another and see each other’s face somehow on the screen, maybe as a cartoon like memojis that we see now or their actual faces floating around. Audios would also help to explain sustainability. 

The other way is to change the video that is being played on the screen altogether and create a more educational experience with videos of countries and places around the world so the children could learn, from the comfort of their home country, about them but also have fun. This would allow them to experience the counties that they can’t visit due to restrictions such as Covid. There could also be audios that provide them with information about what they are seeing or facts about the location itself.
